Contributing Guidelines
The repository is structured language-wise i.e. algorithms in a certain language go in a specific folder.
The naming convention to be followed is algo_name.language_extention i.e. the overall pathshould be language/algo_name.language_extention
Example of above points: heap sort in Java should go into java/heapsort.java
It is your choice to include only the function or the entire program for the algorithms.
If folder for your language does not exist, create a new one.
